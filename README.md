# Newb Launcher
A MapleStory Global launcher written in C# using WinForms. An old project that was re-written and kept up-to-date for multiple years through Nexon's attempt to stop third-party launchers up until 2016.   

I have decided to upload it for any developers in the future who may want to look into creating a similar project.   
As this is a fairly old project, it is targetted for the .NET Framework 4.7.2 and requires (Costura) Fody, Newtonsoft.JSON (JSON.NET) & RestSharp.
